### Purpose
The community needs a scenario with the following requirements:
* It has to be able to support different kinds of traffic demand such as congested or free-flow patterns.
* It should support different scenario dimensions.
* It has to include different road categories (e.g. residential, arterial and highway).
* It should allow multi-modal evaluations.
* Is should describe a realistic traffic scenario over one day (i.e. avoid gridlocks and teleportations).

### Use Cases
* Evaluation of different multi-modal strategies for commuters
* Testing protocols and applications on different scales
* On-board routing system to provide scenarios with different levels of congestion to test different re-routing algorithms.
* Test optimisation algorithms for
  * main arterial road (e.g. green waves)
  * emergency protocols (e.g. allow emergency vehicles to be prioritised)
*.. and more ..*
